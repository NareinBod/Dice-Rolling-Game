The Dice Rolling Game is an interactive Python program where users can simulate rolling dice. Players specify the number of dice they want to roll, then choose whether to roll or stop. Each roll generates random outcomes for the dice, displaying the results as tuples. The game keeps track of the total number of rolls and concludes with a summary when the user decides to stop.
